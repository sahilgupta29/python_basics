       "'\\nAutocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plots are important tools in identifying the order of autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components in ARIMA models.\\n\\nHere\\'s how ACF and PACF plots help in identifying the order of ARIMA models:\\n\\n1. **Autocorrelation Function (ACF) Plot**:\\n   - The ACF plot displays the correlation between a time series and its lagged values at different lag intervals.\\n   - In an ARIMA model, the ACF plot can help identify the order of the MA component. The significant autocorrelation values at certain lags indicate the presence of MA terms in the model.\\n   - If there is a significant autocorrelation at lag k, it suggests that the series may be predictable up to lag k.\\n\\n2. **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) Plot**:\\n   - The PACF plot displays the correlation between a time series and its lagged values after removing the linear dependence of the intermediate lags.\\n   - In an ARIMA model, the PACF plot can help identify the order of the AR component. The significant partial autocorrelation values at certain lags indicate the presence of AR terms in the model.\\n   - If there is a significant partial autocorrelation at lag k, it suggests that the series may be predictable using lag k, after removing the effects of intermediate lags.\\n\\n3. **Interpretation**:\\n   - By examining the ACF and PACF plots, analysts can identify the \"cut-off\" points where autocorrelation values become non-significant. These cut-off points suggest potential orders for the AR and MA components.\\n   - The order of the AR component is typically indicated by significant spikes at the PACF plot, while the order of the MA component is indicated by significant spikes at the ACF plot.\\n   - Based on the significant lags observed in the ACF and PACF plots, analysts can determine the appropriate orders (p and q) for the ARIMA model.\\n\\nIn summary, ACF and PACF plots provide valuable insights into the autocorrelation structure of time series data and help identify the order of AR and MA components in ARIMA models.

    "   - The PACF plot displays the correlation between a time series and its lagged values after removing the linear dependence of the intermediate lags.\n",
