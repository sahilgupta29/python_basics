    "3. **Too Few Training Samples**: Insufficient training data can limit the ability of a model to learn the underlying patterns in the data, leading to underfitting. This is particularly true for complex datasets with many features or nonlinear relationships.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Over-regularization**: Excessive regularization, such as strong L1 or L2 penalties in regularization techniques like ridge regression or Lasso regression, can lead to underfitting by overly constraining the model's flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Poor Hyperparameter Tuning**: Choosing inappropriate hyperparameters for the model, such as a too-small number of layers or units in a neural network, can result in underfitting. Inadequate tuning of hyperparameters can prevent the model from learning the underlying patterns in the data effectively.\n",

    "7. **Inadequate Training Time**: Terminating the training process prematurely before the model has converged to the optimal solution can result in underfitting. Insufficient training time prevents the model from fully learning the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
