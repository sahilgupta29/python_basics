    "**When Lasso is More Appropriate:**\n",
    "Lasso regularization is more appropriate in the following scenarios:\n",
    "- When you suspect that only a subset of predictors are relevant and you want to perform feature selection.\n",
    "- When you want a simpler and more interpretable model by reducing the number of predictors with negligible impact.\n",
    "- When dealing with a high-dimensional dataset where the number of predictors is close to or larger than the number of observations.\n",
    "- When you have prior knowledge that some predictors should have a negligible effect or should be excluded from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, Lasso regularization adds the absolute values of coefficients to the loss function, leading to sparse solutions \n",
    "and feature selection. It's suitable when you want a simpler model, have many predictors, or suspect that only a subset\n",
    "of predictors are important. It's different from Ridge regularization, which uses squared coefficients and mainly focuses\n",
