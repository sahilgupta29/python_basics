    "\"\"\"To calculate the covariance between each pair of variables, we need to have the dataset. Covariance measures the extent to which two variables change together. A positive covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase, while a negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. However, the magnitude of the covariance is not standardized and depends on the scales of the variables.\n",
