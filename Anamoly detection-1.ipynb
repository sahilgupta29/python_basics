These neighbors are typically determined using distance metrics like Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.\\n\\n2. **Compute Reachability Distance**: For each neighbor of \\\\( p \\\\), compute the reachability distance of \\\\( p \\\\) with respect to that neighbor. The reachability distance of \\\\( p \\\\) with respect to a neighbor \\\\( q \\\\) is the maximum of the distance between \\\\( p \\\\) and \\\\( q \\\\), and the reachability distance of \\\\( q \\\\). This step measures how reachable \\\\( p \\\\) is from its neighbors.\\n\\n3. **Calculate Local Reachability Density**: Compute the local reachability density of each data point \\\\( p \\\\). This is the inverse of the average reachability distance of \\\\( p \\\\) with respect to its \\\\( k \\\\) nearest neighbors. It represents how densely \\\\( p \\\\) is surrounded by its neighbors.\\n\\n4. **Compute Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: For each data point \\\\( p \\\\), calculate the Local Outlier Factor (LOF). The LOF of \\\\( p \\\\) quantifies how much the local density of \\\\( p \\\\) differs from the local densities of its neighbors. It is the ratio of the average local reachability density of the \\\\( k \\\\) nearest neighbors of \\\\( p \\\\) to the local reachability density of \\\\( p \\\\) itself. A high LOF indicates that \\\\( p \\\\) has a significantly lower density compared to its neighbors, suggesting it is an outlier.\\n\\n5. **Normalize LOF Scores (Optional)**: Optionally, LOF scores can be normalized to a specified range for better interpretation or comparison across datasets.\\n\\n6. **Anomaly Score**: The anomaly score for each data point is typically set to be the LOF score. Higher LOF scores indicate higher likelihood of being an outlier.\\n\\nBy following these steps, the LOF algorithm identifies outliers by considering the local density patterns of the data points, making it effective for detecting anomalies in datasets where global density varies.'"

It quantifies the degree of \"outlierness\" of each data point based on the concept that outliers are often located in regions of lower density compared to their neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the LOF algorithm computes anomaly scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate Nearest Neighbors**: For each data point \\( p \\), find its \\( k \\) nearest neighbors. These neighbors are typically determined using distance metrics like Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Reachability Distance**: For each neighbor of \\( p \\), compute the reachability distance of \\( p \\) with respect to that neighbor. The reachability distance of \\( p \\) with respect to a neighbor \\( q \\) is the maximum of the distance between \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), and the reachability distance of \\( q \\). This step measures how reachable \\( p \\) is from its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Local Reachability Density**: Compute the local reachability density of each data point \\( p \\). This is the inverse of the average reachability distance of \\( p \\) with respect to its \\( k \\) nearest neighbors. It represents how densely \\( p \\) is surrounded by its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: For each data point \\( p \\), calculate the Local Outlier Factor (LOF). The LOF of \\( p \\) quantifies how much the local density of \\( p \\) differs from the local densities of its neighbors. It is the ratio of the average local reachability density of the \\( k \\) nearest neighbors of \\( p \\) to the local reachability density of \\( p \\) itself. A high LOF indicates that \\( p \\) has a significantly lower density compared to its neighbors, suggesting it is an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Normalize LOF Scores (Optional)**: Optionally, LOF scores can be normalized to a specified range for better interpretation or comparison across datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Anomaly Score**: The anomaly score for each data point is typically set to be the LOF score. Higher LOF scores indicate higher likelihood of being an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, the LOF algorithm identifies outliers by considering the local density patterns of the data points, making it effective for detecting anomalies in datasets where global density varies.\"\"\""
