    "\"\"\"DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm that can also be used for anomaly detection, particularly for detecting outliers in a dataset. Here's how DBSCAN detects anomalies and the key parameters involved in the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Density-Based Clustering**:\n",
    "   - DBSCAN groups together closely packed points based on their density. It defines clusters as continuous regions of high density separated by regions of low density.\n",
    "   - Core Points: A core point is a data point that has at least a specified number of other points (MinPts) within a specified distance (Eps).\n",
    "   - Border Points: A border point is a point that is within Eps distance of a core point but does not have enough neighbors to be considered a core point itself.\n",
    "   - Noise Points: Noise points are data points that are neither core points nor border points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Anomaly Detection**:\n",
    "   - DBSCAN detects anomalies by considering points that are not assigned to any cluster as potential outliers or anomalies.\n",
    "   - Noise points, which are not part of any cluster, are typically considered anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Parameters**:\n",
    "   - **Eps (Epsilon)**: Eps is the maximum distance between two points for them to be considered as part of the same neighborhood. It defines the radius of the neighborhood around each point. Points within this distance are considered neighbors.\n",
    "   - **MinPts (Minimum Points)**: MinPts is the minimum number of points required to form a dense region. A point is classified as a core point if it has at least MinPts neighbors within Eps distance. Increasing MinPts reduces the likelihood of considering noise points as anomalies.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm**: DBSCAN supports different algorithms for computing the neighborhood of points, such as 'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', or 'brute'. The choice of algorithm can affect the performance and scalability of the DBSCAN algorithm.\n",
