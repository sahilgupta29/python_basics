       "'Outliers can have a significant impact on both measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, and mode)\\nand measures of dispersion (such as range, variance, and standard deviation) in a dataset. Outliers are data points that\\nare significantly different from the rest of the data, either much larger or much smaller. Their presence can distort the\\ncharacteristics of a dataset.\\n\\n**Effect on Measures of Central Tendency:**\\n1. **Mean:** Outliers can heavily influence the mean, pulling it in the direction of the outlier. If an outlier is much larger\\nthan the rest of the data, it can increase the mean, and if it is much smaller, it can decrease the mean.\\n\\n2. **Median:** The median is more resistant to the influence of outliers. It is less affected because it only considers \\nthe middle value, not the actual values themselves. Thus, an outlier has less impact on the median compared to the mean.\\n\\n3. **Mode:** The mode may not be significantly affected by outliers, especially if they are rare occurrences.\\n\\n**Effect on Measures of Dispersion:**\\n1. **Range:** Outliers can significantly increase the range, especially if they are far from the rest of the data. \\nThe range is sensitive to extreme values.\\n\\n2. **Variance and Standard Deviation:** Outliers can dramatically affect the variance and standard deviation. \\nSince these measures consider the squared differences between data points and the mean, outliers can lead to larger deviations, resulting in increased variance and standard deviation.\\n\\n**Example:**\\nConsider a dataset of exam scores for a class:\\n\\n[60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 250]\\n\\n- Mean without outlier: (60 + 65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100) / 9 = 81.67\\n- Mean with outlier: (60 + 65 + 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100 + 250) / 10 = 88\\n\\n- Median without outlier: 85\\n- Median with outlier: 87.5\\n\\n- Range without outlier: 100 - 60 = 40\\n- Range with outlier: 250 - 60 = 190\\n\\n- Variance without outlier: ~303.33\\n- Variance with outlier: ~2172.22\\n\\n- Standard Deviation without outlier: ~17.42\\n- Standard Deviation with outlier: ~46.59\\n\\nIn this example, the outlier (250) significantly affects the mean, range, variance, and standard deviation.\\nHowever, the median and mode are less influenced.
